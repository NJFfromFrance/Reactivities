C#, .NET and React project by Neil Cummings/Udemy

Neil Cummings has a great course on Udemy called 'Complete guide to building an app with .Net Core and React'.
He builds a full stack app using C# and dotnetcore on the backend and React with TypeScript and MobX on the front end.
See: https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-guide-to-building-an-app-with-net-core-and-react 

I took this course and this is my source code and final result: https://reactivities.niekjanferwerda.com.
